# p3wm(8)

## Name

p3wm - Three-way merge .pacnew files

## Synopsis

_p3wm_ <pacnew file>

## Installation

p3wm can be installed from AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/p3wm/

## Description

p3wm tries to merge a .pacnew file into its corresponding local backup (in the sense of *backup* in *PKGBUILD*(5)) file in a three-way merge fashion. p3wm tries to recover a copy of original backup file from pacman's package cache and uses it as the base of three-way merge.

## Environment

p3wm can be configured by setting environment variables:

*P3WM_DEBUG*::
  Debug with the `set -x` option of *bash*(1).

*P3WM_MERGE_TOOL*::
  Override default merge tool. If unset, p3wm will detect existing merge tools in the following order:

  - git-merge-file(1)
  - merge(1)

You can skip the auto detection by setting *P3WM_MERGE_TOOL=builtin_merge_git* or *P3WM_MERGE_TOOL=builtin_merge_merge*.

*Note*: in git(1)'s terms, git launches a "merge tool" to resolve merge conflicts. But in p3wm's terms, we use a merge tool to merge, and use a resolve tool to resolve conflicts if there are any.

*P3WM_RESOLVE_TOOL*::
  Override default resolve tool. If unset, p3wm will detect existing resolve tools in the following order:

  - kdiff3
  - meld
  - vim

You can skip the auto detection by setting *P3WM_RESOLVE_TOOL=builtin_resolve_<cmd>*. Example: if you have both *meld* and *vim* installed, p3wm will prefer *meld*. You can set *P3WM_RESOLVE_TOOL=builtin_resolve_vim* to forcibly choose *vim*.

When p3wm launches the resolve tool, *$P3WM_RESOLVE_TOOL* is **eval**ed in *bash* with the following variables (which resembles how *git-mergetool*(1) works):

[%hardbreaks]
*$LOCAL*: the local backup file that exists in current filesystem tree.
*$BASE*: the base backup file, extracted from an old version of pacakge.
*$REMOTE*: the .pacnew file created by *pacman -Syu*.
*$MERGED*: the merged file with conflicts markers. Users of p3wm are supposed to resolve all the conflicts in this file.
